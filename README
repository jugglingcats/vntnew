VNT (Versioned Node Tree) is a write-only hierarchical database with strong version and 
merge support.

Inspired by CouchDB's approach to immutable btrees, but instead of providing a single btree,
each entry is actually a new btree (thus providing a hierarchy).

VNT should scale to millions of nodes, each containing potentially millions of children.

Partly started as a Kotlin learning project. Sources are Kotlin. Some good progress was made
at the low level but still a lot to do to make it useful.

Not working on this any more due to other commitments, but still interested in the concepts.
There is never the perfect CMS, and for me strong version and merge is a common weakness.
Jackrabbit promised much but the workspace versioning never really worked well. Interwoven
Teamsite worked well back in the day but was very file based. The concepts need bringing up
to date but merging in a way that an editor can understand is a challenge. 

From what I read, Jackrabbit Oak (still in alpha) may share some of the principles of VNT.
