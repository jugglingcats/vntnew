VNT (Versioned Node Tree) is a write-only hierarchical database with strong version and merge support.

Inspired by CouchDB's approach to immutable btrees, but instead of providing a single btree,
each entry is actually a new btree (thus providing hierarchy).

VNT should scale to millions of nodes, each containing potentially millions of children.
